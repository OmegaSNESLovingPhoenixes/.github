## Hello there! We are Cognition-Dev, the successor to GDCCJ. 

Our goal is to eliminate censorship in schools worldwide. 

We are developing games, proxies, and hacks that can bypass censorship. 

Many schools install censorship software or a Chrome extensions on their Chromebooks, which infringes on our privacy. That's why we are committed to stopping this practice.
