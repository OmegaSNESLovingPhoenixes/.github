## Hello there! We are Cognition-Dev, the successor to GDCCJ. 

Our goal is to eliminate censorship in schools worldwide. 

We develop games, proxies, and hacks that can bypass censorship worldwide to stop this infringement of students' privacy. 

Many schools install censorship software or a Chrome extension on their Chromebooks, which infringes on our privacy. That's why we are committed to stopping this practice.
