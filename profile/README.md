## We are the ***Omega SNES Loving Phoenixes***, the unofficial successor to [GDCCJ.](https://github.com/GDCCJ)

Our goal is to eliminate censorship in schools worldwide.

Many schools install censorship software or Chrome extensions on their Chromebooks, which infringes on our privacy. That's why we are committed to stopping this practice.
To prevent this invasion of students' privacy, we develop games, proxies, and other hacks that bypass censorship worldwide. 

We will always provide open-source tools to help students bypass censorship and gain access to the internet.
We also advocate for the safe use of technology and the protection of student privacy. We're dedicated to helping students reclaim their digital rights. 

As an organization, we believe every student deserves the right to access information online without censorship. 
We are passionate about advocating for the safe use of technology and ensuring that student's privacy is protected no matter what.
