## Hi there 👋, we're Cognition-Dev the successor to **GDCCJ** and we're working to stop censorship in schools worldwide!

We build games, prrxies, and JavaScript hacks to stop censorship in schools.
Most schools have a special prrxy that is forced onto our school chromebooks or an extension, so we work to stop this invasion of our most precious power.
<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
